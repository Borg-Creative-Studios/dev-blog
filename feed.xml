As someone who has grown up with a speech impediment, I understand how frustrating and exhausting it can be.</blockquote>

  <p>
    Our goal for MySpeech is for it to be free for anyone. The currently available software can be very expensive, and no one should have to pay to have a voice.

  <p>
    We have now released BCS Marketing MK 4 for use!
  </p>

  <p>
    MK 4 features improved load times and backend resources. These backend resources improve compatibility and make it easier for us to add technical updates in the future.
  </p>

    <h2 id="for-publishers">
      For Publishers
    </h2>

    <h4 id="update-from-mk-3">
      Update from MK 3
    </h4>

  <p>
    To update from MK 3, all you have to do is replace the "www" in the embed source to "source" and we got it from there.
  </p>

    <h4 id="install-mk-4">
      Install MK 4
    </h4>

  <p>
    There are two ways to install the marketing bar.
  </p>

  <p>
    Method 1: To install MK 4 on your site (After becoming an approved publisher), paste the embed code* into the source for your website wherever you want the ads to appear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Method 2:&nbsp;To install MK 4 on your site (After becoming an approved publisher), paste the script link* into the source for your website wherever you want the ads to appear. After pasting the script*, you will need to paste the function command into the &lt;body&gt; tag of your page.
  </p>

  <p>
    *Approved publishers will have the embed script links emailed to them.
  </p>

    <h2 id="platform-compatibilitynbsp">
      Platform Compatibility&nbsp;
    </h2>

  <p>
    Method 1: This method is the most compatible with publishing platforms. It has been tested on Blogger, but is expected to function on a premium WordPress plan (Functions like MK3 and MK3 has been tested on WordPress).
  </p>

  <p>
    Method 2: Best for self-hosted and static pages (GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, etc). Basically, any platform that you have full control of the source code. This is method will provide the best compatibility.&nbsp;

<p>These days websites have extensive tracking and cookie-usage in order to create a “better” user experience. However, do these technologies actually improve the user’s experience in the long run? No.</p>
<p>By these companies tracking and recording so much information about their users, they run the risk of that data being hacked or obtained through other means. Which can eventually harm the user’s privacy and security.</p>
<p>But, how then does a company create a better user experience (like remembering a user’s page settings)? Well, that is where Project Pear comes into play.</p>
<p>Project Pear utilizes JavaScript and DOM to create user specific environments without any cookies or trackers. Users are able to create user names and edit the homepage links. By using JavaScript and DOM, the Project Pear website is able to store the user’s settings directly in their browser, not on a server. This not only helps protect the user’s privacy, but helps improve site load time by reducing the amount of data that has to be stored on the server.</p>

<p>*The Project Pear website is currently not mobile compatible.</p>
